  - Parallelize the loop that combines training images and labels by dividing data into chunks and processing them concurrently.\n","\n","2. **Data transfer to GPU:**\n","   - Use **CUDA streams** to

device-to-host transfers.\n","\n","3. **Forward pass (Model computation):**\n","   - Parallelize the matrix multiplications in `Forward` by distributing computations across GPU threads:\n","     - Use a **thread-per-element strategy** for matrix operations, where each thread calculates one output matrix element.\n","     - Leverage **tiling and shared memory** to reduce global memory accesses.\n","\n","4. **Backward pass (Gradient computation):**\n","   - In `Backward`, compute gradients in parallel:\n","     - Assign threads to calculate gradients for individual weights and biases.\n","     - Use **warp-level reductions** for aggregating gradient contributions across threads.\n","     - Store intermediate results in shared memory to reduce memory access latency.\n","\n","5. **Weight updates:**\n","   - Parallelize the weight update process in `Update`:\n","     - Assign one thread per parameter (weight or bias) to update its value independently.\n","
